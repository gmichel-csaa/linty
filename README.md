[Linty](https://www.lintyapp.com) is _Linting as a Service_. Users can sign in with Github, select a repo, and immediately get linting for their code.

Features:
* One click repo registration
* Pass/Fail statuses on Pull Requests
* History of lint results
* Pass/Fail Badges for your READMEs

The app is live at [lintyapp.com](https://www.lintyapp.com). Linty is still under heavy development, and is likely to change often and significantly. Things might break. Use with discretion.

### Setup

**Python**:

As long as you have a `requirements.txt` in the root of your project, Linty will run [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) against your project. You can configure pycodestyle using a `setup.cfg` file in the root of the project. See [ours](https://github.com/ZeroCater/linty/blob/master/setup.cfg) for an example.

**Javascript**:

Linty supports eslint for JS projects. If your project has a `package.json` file in the root directory, Linty will run eslint, respecting any configuration files you have.

Support for more JS linters, as well as configuring which linters Linty runs, is on the roadmap. 

### Development

To get linty running locally for development, you'll need a few things:
* Python 3
* virtualenv/pyenv to stay sane
* PostgreSQL (I highly recommend [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/) for Mac)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroCater/linty.git && cd linty
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
cp .env.sample .env

```

Edit `.env` as necessary.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

You now have the server running!
